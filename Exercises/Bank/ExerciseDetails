The bank account exercise is an exercise that I invented and coded, without any reference.
This exercise's aim was to test my knowledge about basic thread functions.

There's a bank account, labelled with a name, which represents the owner, and a bank account type, which 
describes the type of the account (family or personal).
A bank account can be asigned to one person or to multiple people and each one of them can perform the following actions:
- withrawal
- deposit

At the end of thye program, the following informations are printed regarding an account:
- total amount of money withdrawn
- total amount of money deposited
- available funds

The amount of money withdrawn and deposited are not deterministic: they are randomized.

Thread topics treated:
- synchronized blocks --> race conditions
- thread manipulation (join, notify)
